# Project: Name that Celebrity! iOS App

# This project is an iOS app in which the user has to answer 7 multiple choice questions. In each question, a picture of some celebrity is shown, and the user has to figure out the name of the celebrity and choose the corresponding answer choice. Hints are also provided with each question. After all the questions are answered the user's score is shown. In this project I learned how to add different view controllers to my app, along with how to make them interact with each other. The project can be opened and tested using Xcode on a Mac.

# This project was written using Swift.
